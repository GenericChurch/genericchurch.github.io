<p>TC Kids is the children’s ministry for Thursday Church, and everybody from birth through fifth grade is invited!</p>

<p><i><b>Our Mission:</b></i> “Where little hands and feet are helping to build God’s Kingdom.”</p>

<p>Here at Thursday Church we are dedicated to teaching children about Jesus Christ and aiding in the development and growth in their faith in Jesus. Going beyond the walls of the Church, our Children’s Ministry seeks to reach out and make new disciples.</p>

<p><i><b>Thursday Evening Service:</b></i></p>

<p>Our Thursday evening services are a welcoming and fun time for children to learn about God in a safe environment. For the safety of our children, they are required to “check-in” prior to entering our Children’s Department at the Child-Check in station.</p>

<p>We have 5 classrooms in our Children’s Department on Thursday evenings. Children in preschool through grade five participate in three interactive centers during the service, which include Lesson, Craft, and Snack. Infants and toddlers are fed a snack and are allowed play time during the service.</p>

<p>The following classes are available on Thursdays:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Newborn to 18 months</li>
	<li>18 months to age 3</li>
	<li>Preschool and Kindergarten</li>
	<li>1st and 2nd graders</li>
	<li>3rd, 4th, and 5th</li>
</ul>
<i>Sunday Morning Service:</i>

<p>3 Classrooms Available:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Nursery: Newborn to Age 2</span></li>
