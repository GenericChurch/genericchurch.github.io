<!--h2>Why We Give</h2-->

<p>As people who believe that all we have is from God, we give in grateful recognition of this. As people who want to trust God in every area of our life, we give because it is an act of faith. As people who long to honor God, we give as an act of obedience. As people who love God and love people, we give as an expression of this love. As people with an eternal mindset, we give to invest in heavenly things.</p>
