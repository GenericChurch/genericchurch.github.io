I"	<p>Weâ€™re celebrating Easter around the globe. Find a LifeChurch.tv Easter experience near you or anywhere through <a href="//live.lifechurch.tv">Church Online</a>.</p>

<p>When Jesus asks us why we doubt, our answer reveals more about our faith than our intellect. This Easter, join us for our current series, <a href="/watch/the-counselor/">The Counselor</a>.</p>
