<h3>How long is a Thursday Church service?</h3>
   
<p>Thursday Church services usually last about <strong>1 hour in length</strong>. Services begin with the TC band leading the church in music song lyrics are projected onto the screens and tvs so you can sing along and/or engage with worship however you feel most comfortable. After the music portion of service is complete, one of our pastors or guest speakers will share a message about Jesus.</p>

<h3>What&#039;s the culture like at Thursday Church?</h3>


<p>Thursday Church is a casual Coffee House atmosphere with a “Rock & Roll” sound where relationships with Christ and others take precedence over <strong>religion</strong>. Come as you are and expect to feel welcomed as our guest.</p>


<h3>What about my kids?</h3>

<p>We believe that kids should have a blast at church every single week - and at Thursday Church, we make this a priority. The other thing we make a priority is <strong>your children’s safety</strong>. Because of that, we have a detailed check-in process for our Thursday Church program the first time that you visit. You’ll want to leave yourself an extra ten minutes to get signed in for the Thursday Church Kids experience. Kids ministry is offered at every Thursday Church service for kids <strong>ages infant through Grade 8</strong>.</p>
