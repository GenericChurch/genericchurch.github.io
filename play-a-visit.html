<h1>What can I expect?</h1>

<h3>How long is a Life Abundant service?</h3>
   
<p>In total, a Life Abundant service is about <strong>60 minutes in length</strong>. Services begin with the Life Abundant band leading the church in music - song lyrics are projected onto the screens so you can sing along and/or engage with worship however you feel most comfortable. After the music portion of service is complete, one of our pastors will come out to share an encouraging and hope-filled message about Jesus.</p>

<h3>What&#039;s the culture like at Life Abundant?</h3>
