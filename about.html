<h1>Meeting Time</h1>

<p>We meet on Thursdays at 6:45 pm at both our Vincennes and Bicknell Campuses. Vincennes offers a second service on Sunday mornings at 10:45 am. We have a French (Creole) Service on Sundays at 12:30 pm.</p>

<h1>Why Thursday?</h1>

<p>Why NOT Thursday? Sunday morning just doesn’t work for everyone for several reasons. We want to offer an alternative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable.”<br />
<em>Romans 14:5 (NLT)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We consider everyday to be a Holy Day, a gift given to each of us and we’re to use it in a way that pleases God.</p>

<h1>Come as You Are</h1>

<p>Thursday Church is a casual Coffee House atmosphere with a “<em>Rock &amp; Roll</em>” sound where relationships with Christ and others take precedence over “religion”. If you aren’t a Sunday morning person – then Thursday evening is a great alternative!</p>

<h1>Questions?</h1>

<p>Not quite sure about your relationship with Christ? That’s OK. Thursday Church welcomes people at all stages of life and has programs that can help you discover Christ at your own pace.</p>

<h1>Practical and Culturally Relevant Messages</h1>

<p>Thursday Church teaches practical messages relevant to everyday living from the Bible. It’s our goal to always present a message that will help you succeed in this world as a Christian and as a person. We provide study notes each week that are intended to help you think through the message.</p>

<h1>Worship</h1>

<p>Our worship style is participatory, with interaction, videos, music, drama, and singing. Our services last about an hour and offer an opportunity to learn, interact, and meet others who want to do the same.</p>

<h1>Children’s Ministry</h1>

<p><em>Vincennes Campus:</em><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thursday</span>: Children from birth – 5th grade are downstairs in our Children’s Ministry Area. We require our children to be checked-in prior to entering. Once checked in, two bar-codes are printed; one for the child and one for the adult. You must have your bar code in order to get downstairs. The doors to downstairs are locked to ensure safety and open at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday</span>: Children from birth – 5th grade are downstairs in our Children’s Ministry Area. Adults must walk their children downstairs and check them in. The doors downstairs are locked and will open at 10:30 AM.</p>

<p><em>Bicknell Campus:</em><br />
During the service children from birth – 5<sup>th</sup> grade are dismissed from the platform. Children can be picked up after service from Mrs. Courtney at the back of the worship area.</p>

<h1>Giving</h1>

<p>We see Giving as an act of worship by Giving back to God what is His in the first place. You can drop your Giving and Purple Prayer Request into the bucket as it is passed down your row. Our Giving funds the ministries at Thursday Church. Online Giving is available by clicking the link at the top of the page.</p>
